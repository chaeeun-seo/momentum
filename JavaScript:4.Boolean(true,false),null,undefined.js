// learn Boolean (true, false)

// when do we use Boolean
// EX. when we want to check if a user logged in or not
// EX. is the video playing
// EX. is the website loaded



// learn null, undefined
// Data Types that are non-existing, undefined, nothing

// 1. null : nothing
// there is value but nothing
// null never happens naturally
// null happens when we make sure that something doesn't exist in the variable
// use null when I want to tell JS that this value is literally nothing
const amISmart = null;
console.log(amISmart);

// 2. undefined : something exists but no value
// variable exists but is not defined
// variable exists in the computer memory
// there is space in the memory of the computer but is not defined 
// variable is created, computer is aware of that variable but it doesn't have a value
let something;
console.log(something);



// Comparison between JS and Python
// JS(null) VS. Python(None)
// JS(true) VS. Python(True)
// JS(false) VS. Python(False)
